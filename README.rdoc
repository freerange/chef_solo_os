= chef_solo_os

This repository is used to build a generic server via Chef Solo.
You can then use the following repositories to create accounts, setup
Apache +passenger, and your virtualhosts.
  http://github.com/retr0h/chef_solo_accounts/tree/master
  http://github.com/retr0h/chef_solo_apache2/tree/master

Chef Solo allows you to run Chef Cookbooks in the absence of a Chef Server.
It does this by requiring that the complete cookbook be present on disk, which
it will fetch by getting a tarball from a remote URL.
