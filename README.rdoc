= chef_solo_os

This repository is used to build a generic server via Chef Solo.  You can then use the following
repositories to further refine your deployments.
  http://github.com/retr0h/chef_solo_accounts
  http://github.com/retr0h/chef_solo_apache2

Chef Solo allows you to run Chef Cookbooks in the absence of a Chef Server.  It does this by requiring
that the complete cookbook be present on disk, which it will fetch by getting a tarball from a remote URL.
